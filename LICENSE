## UTL-ACS License Agreement (v1.0 - Updated)

**Preamble**  
This License governs the Unified Tensor-Logic Framework for Autonomous Code Synthesis (UTL-ACS v1.0), including its abstract, ontology, operators, equations, tables, and validation program (collectively, the "Work"). The Work is copyrighted by Taylor Christian Mattheisen (© 2025). This License grants permissions for non-commercial use while requiring a paid commercial license for business applications [1].

**Grant of License**  
- **Free Non-Commercial Use**: You may freely use, copy, modify, distribute, and perform the Work for personal, educational, research, or non-profit purposes without payment. Attribution to the author is required in all copies or derivatives.
- **Commercial Use**: Any use in a commercial product, service, or revenue-generating activity requires a separate paid license. Contact the author via primary email **ArchitectPrime38@proton.me**, or platforms like Etsy, Gumroad, Itch.io, or Ko-fi for pricing and terms [1].

**Restrictions**  
- No resale, sublicensing, or bundling of the Work (or derivatives) as a standalone product without permission.
- Modifications must preserve core concepts like the triadic ontology and ground-return mandate; altered versions require clear labeling (e.g., "Based on UTL-ACS v1.0").
- Prohibited: Use in AI training datasets, military applications, or malware without explicit written approval.

**Warranty and Liability**  
The Work is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. The author disclaims liability for errors, failures, or damages from use. Validation metrics (e.g., 98% coherence) are aspirational and unverified [1].

**Termination**  
This License terminates automatically upon violation. Paid commercial licenses follow separate agreements.

**Governing Law**  
This License is governed by U.S. law. Disputes resolved in courts of competent jurisdiction.

For commercial inquiries or custom licenses, email **ArchitectPrime38@proton.me** or message on listed platforms.
